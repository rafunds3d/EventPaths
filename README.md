# Inequality Zoo for Event Path Polytopes

In vertices .txt files we provide the set of all deterministic assignments that define the classical polytope. The vertices represent the V-representation of the polytope. 

In facets .txt files, we provide the set of facet-defining inequalities for the event path polytopes. We find those by using standard algorithmic tools for a given V-representation one can find a facet representation for the polytope (so-called H-representation). The tool we used was the program PORTA (http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/PORTA/) which has the command traf that does the job.
